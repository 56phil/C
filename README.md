A project to help a friend get a step closer to graduation.

This is a python program that can read a text file (fn_i) and write a text file with named fs_o. It reads the very first data set, determines where the protein sequence is in the count. Then in every subsequent data set the program will only return data that is related to that count. This will remove data that does that does not precisely align with Drosophila sequence positions  (wether they are dash or letter). When rewriting each data set it should start with > then Species name an enter and then the protein sequence string.
