A project to help a friend get a step closer to graduation.

This is a python program that can read a text file containing two or more data sets. The first data set, determines where the protein sequence is in the count. Then in the remaining data sets the program will only return data that is related to that count by replacing data that does that does not precisely align with the positions of the first data set (wether they are dash or letter) with a plus.
